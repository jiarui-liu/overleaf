# ML Paper Writing Tutor — Skill Library

This skill library is consumed by `AiTutorReviewOrchestrator.mjs`, which runs a 6-phase review pipeline. Skill files are loaded via `loadSkill()` and injected into LLM system prompts as reference material for specialized reviewer subagents. Each file is tagged with its modality requirement:
- **[TEXT]** — can be applied by reading the LaTeX source only.
- **[MULTIMODAL]** — requires viewing compiled figures/tables/images.

### Review Pipeline Overview

1. **Section Parsing** — Extracts sections from merged LaTeX (no LLM).
2. **Paper Type Classification** — Loads `paper_type_definitions.md`; LLM classifies the paper and generates type-specific guidance.
3. **Parallel Reviewer Subagents** — 11 static agents (each with assigned skill files) + up to 2 dynamic agents (paper type, venue) run in parallel. Skill files are concatenated into each agent's system prompt under "Writing Skills Reference."
4. **Comment Deduplication** — Removes overlapping feedback across agents.
5. **Strict-Mode Pruning** — LLM selects top-N comments if count exceeds threshold.
6. **Position Mapping** — Maps comments back from merged.tex to original documents.
